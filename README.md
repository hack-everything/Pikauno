# The Pikaduino

### A simple and cute project, designed by me and Xieshi Zhang, and sponsored by [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com)


The Pikauno is a small Pikachu/Pokemon themed badge, based off the [Arduino](https://arduino.cc) Pro Mini, the Pikauno is one of the first "Pikachu Arduinos" in its existence (a simple google search provided nothing similar).


# This cute badge features: 

  - ATMEGA328P-AU
  - 2 RGB LEDs on the front (eyes)
  - Micro-USB for power and programming
  - 3 buttons (2 'programmable', 1 reset) 
  - MPU6050 (3-axis accelerometer / gyroscope)
  - HAT compatiible! (click [here](https://github.com/hack-everything/Pikauno/blob/main/README.md#hats) to learn more.
  - 2 Yellow power LEDs on top of ears and 2 'underglow' LEDs on the back


The ATMEGA328P-AU's specs are:

    - CPU Speed (MIPS/DMIPS) 20
    - Program Memory Size (KB) 32
    - SRAM (B) 2,048
    - Data EEPROM/HEF (bytes) 1024

# HATs! 

HATs are pretty much custom Arduino shields. They attach on top of the ears. Currently, a music hat, a 'gaming' hat and others are in development.

These HATs will be shaped like hats! Some like a detective hat, baseball cap, etc.
